Here is the rewritten README with some improvements:

# Scrapegraph Search Tool

## Introduction
The Scrapegraph Search Tool is a powerful utility that leverages Scrapegraph AI's SearchScraper API to perform intelligent web searches and extract relevant information from search results. This tool combines search capabilities with AI-powered content extraction, making it ideal for research and information gathering tasks.

## Getting Started

### Installation
To install the required packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Example Usage

#### Basic Usage
```python
from crewai_tools import ScrapegraphSearchTool

# Basic usage with API key
tool = ScrapegraphSearchTool(api_key="your_api_key")
result = tool.run(
    user_prompt="What is the latest version of Python?"
)
```

#### Custom Headers
```python
# Using custom headers
tool = ScrapegraphSearchTool(api_key="your_api_key")
result = tool.run(
    user_prompt="Find recent tech news",
    headers={
        "User-Agent": "Custom User Agent",
        "Cookie": "custom_cookie=value"
    }
)
```

#### Output Schema
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class NewsItem(BaseModel):
    title: str
    date: str
    summary: str

# With output schema
tool = ScrapegraphSearchTool(api_key="your_api_key")
result = tool.run(
    user_prompt="Find latest AI news",
    output_schema=NewsItem
)
```

#### Error Handling
```python
try:
    tool = ScrapegraphSearchTool(api_key="your_api_key")
    result = tool.run(user_prompt="Search query")
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Configuration error: {e}")  # Handles invalid prompts or missing API keys
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Search error: {e}")  # Handles API or network errors
```

## Arguments
The following arguments are available:

* `user_prompt`: The search query or prompt (required)
* `headers`: Custom headers for the request (optional)
* `output_schema`: Pydantic model to structure the output (optional)
* `api_key`: Your Scrapegraph API key (required, can be set via `SCRAPEGRAPH_API_KEY` environment variable)

## Environment Variables
The following environment variable is supported:

* `SCRAPEGRAPH_API_KEY`: Your Scrapegraph API key, which can be obtained [here](https://scrapegraphai.com)

## Rate Limiting
The Scrapegraph API has rate limits that vary based on your subscription plan. To avoid rate limit errors, consider the following best practices:

* Implement appropriate delays between requests
* Handle rate limit errors gracefully
* Monitor your API usage on the Scrapegraph dashboard

## Error Handling
The tool may raise the following exceptions:

* `ValueError`: When API key is missing or prompt is invalid
* `RuntimeError`: When search operation fails (network issues, API errors)
* `RateLimitError`: When API rate limits are exceeded

## Best Practices
To get the most out of the Scrapegraph Search Tool, follow these best practices:

1. Use specific and clear search prompts
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Consider caching frequently searched queries
4. Monitor your API usage through the Scrapegraph dashboard

I made the following changes:

* Improved formatting and readability
* Added section headers and subheaders
* Reformatted code blocks for better readability
* Added a brief introduction to the tool
* Emphasized the importance of error handling and rate limiting
* Provided more detailed information on best practices
* Changed some minor wording and phrasing for clarity and consistency
